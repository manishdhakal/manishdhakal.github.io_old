<b>Computer Engineer & Machine Learning Researcher</b>

Hello, I'm Manish Dhakal, a <b> Computer Engineering graduate </b> from the Institute of Engineering, Pulchowk Campus, Tribhuvan University. Currently, I am working as a <b> Research Assistant (RA)</b> at NAAMII, specializing in segmentation and object detection tasks within the field of medical imaging.

My research projects encompass both unimodal and multimodal (esp. <b> vision-language </b>) learning, for the purpose of segmentation and object detection in medical imaging. I have also been involved in a project of the segmentation task of <b>3D mesh data</b>. My passion lies in exploring the potential of multimodal learning techniques.

Prior to my current role, I gained valuable experience as an <b> intern in blockchain engineering </b> and also worked as a <b> fullstack developer and co-founder </b> at a Nepal-based startup, Techniti Nepal. These experiences broadened my skill set and provided insights into various areas of technology and entrepreneurship.

During my undergraduate studies, our academic team worked on capstone project of automatic speech recognition for the <b> low-resourced Nepali Language </b> which was later presented at an IEEE conference.

I'm currently looking for new ML/AI research opportunities. My desire to contribute to these sectors and investigate cutting-edge solutions is motivated by a sincere curiosity. I'm looking forward to relevant <b> Ph.D. programs</b> to further my education and give back to the ML/AI community.
