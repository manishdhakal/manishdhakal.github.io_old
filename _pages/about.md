<b>Computer Engineer & Machine Learning Researcher</b>

Hello, I'm Manish Dhakal, a <b> Computer Engineering graduate </b> from the Institute of Engineering, Pulchowk Campus, Tribhuvan University, where I received a <b> full scholarship </b> for my studies. Currently, I am working as a <b> Research Assistant </b> at NAAMII, specializing in segmentation and object detection tasks within the field of medical imaging.

My research projects encompass both unimodal and multimodal (ie. <b> vision-language </b>) learning approaches, for the purpose of segmentation and object detection in medical imaging. I have also been involved in a project of the segmentation task of <b>3D mesh data</b>. My passion lies in exploring the potential of multimodal learning techniques.

Prior to my current role, I gained valuable experience as an <b> intern in blockchain engineering </b> and also worked as a <b> fullstack developer and co-founder </b> at a Nepal-based startup, Techniti Nepal. These experiences broadened my skill set and provided insights into various areas of technology and entrepreneurship.

My expertise primarily lies in machine learning and AI, and I am dedicated to developing innovative solutions and algorithms in these fields. I take pride in being the <b> lead author </b> of a research paper on speech recognition for the <b> low-resourced Nepali Language </b>, which was published in an IEEE conference.

I'm currently looking for new ML/AI research opportunities. My desire to contribute to these sectors and investigate cutting-edge solutions is motivated by a sincere curiosity. I'm presently <b>looking at Masters and Ph.D. programs</b> to further my education and give back to the ML/AI community.
